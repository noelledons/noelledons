# :computer: Welcome to my page 
Hello there, it's nice to see you here!

My name is Noelle :wave: I am a Mathematics with Economics Graduate who is passionate about Technology and creating equal opportunties for all. Since 2019, I have been building a solid foundation in Frontend and Backend technologies. In my spare time, I have been creating responsive web applications and using my skills to manipulate and analyse data. My current Tech stack includes HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Python and SQL (and it will continue to grow!) :smile:
